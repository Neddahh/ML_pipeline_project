# ML_pipeline_project
This is the first project to showcase how an ML project works end to end. 

I have been dribbling my hands on data analytics, but never fully caught on as to how an ML pipeline project works end-to-end. 
Luckily, I came across a very useful resource on Medium. 
One thing led to another and I now I am fully implementing an end-to-end ML pipeline project.
